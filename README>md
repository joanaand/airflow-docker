Snow Resort Data Pipeline

An automated data pipeline that scrapes ski resort data, enriches it with geolocation and weather information, and loads it into BigQuery for analysis in Looker Studio. The pipeline is orchestrated with Apache Airflow, containerized with Docker, and deployed on a Google Cloud VM.

Scrapes ski resort data from a public website
Cleans and standardizes the dataset
Geocodes resort locations using an AP
Fetches weather forecasts
Uploads the final CSV to Google Cloud Storage
Loads the data into BigQuery
Visualizes results in Looker Studio
The pipeline runs daily using an Airflow DAG.
